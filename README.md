# Sample-Code

A Collection of Code Samples Written in C++, Java, Python, Perl and Awk.

## Awk

* report.awk

## C++

* geometry.cpp
    * Determines whether or not a given point is contained in a given rectangle.
* TempConverter.cpp
    * Converts a Celsius temperature from user input to its Fahrenheit equivalent and displays the result.
* encryption.cpp
    * Encrypts a file by reading characters from a file into a 2D array, transposing the array and 
      writing the characters from the array to an output file until the input file has been read.
* parser.cpp

      a LinkedQueue to guarantee shortest path to exit the maze.
* pickle.py
    * A Python program written to demonstrate the serializing and de-serializing a Python object data structure.
* radixSort.py
    * Sort n nonnegative integers, represented in base 10, in nondecreasing order.
